In contrast, the saccadic system becomes mature earlier than the smooth pursuit system. Therefore, the present study investigates whether the early mature saccadic system compensates for the lower pursuit performance during childhood. To answer this question, horizontal eye movements were recorded in 58 children (ages 5-16 yr) and 16 adults (ages 23-36 yr) in a task that required the combination of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements. Smooth pursuit performance improved with age. However, children had larger average position error during target tracking compared with adults, but they did not execute more saccades to compensate for their low pursuit performance despite the early maturity of their saccadic system. This absence of error correction suggests that children have a lower sensitivity to visual errors compared with adults. This reduced sensitivity might stem from poor internal models and longer processing time in young children.},

	abstract = {Predicting the consequences of our own actions through internal models is an essential component of motor control. Previous studies showed improvement of anticipatory behaviors with age for grasping, drawing and postural control. Since these actions require visual and proprioceptive feedback, these improvements might reflect both the development of internal models and the feedback control. In contrast, visual tracking of a temporarily invisible target gives specific markers of prediction and internal models for eye movements. Therefore, we recorded eye movements in 50 children (aged from 5 to 19 years) and in 10 adults who were asked to pursue a visual target that is temporarily blanked. Results show that the youngest children (5-7y) have a general oculomotor behavior in this task qualitatively similar to the one observed in adults. However, the overall performance of older subjects in terms of accuracy at target reappearance and variability in their behavior was much better than the youngest children. This late maturation of predictive mechanisms with age was reflected into the development of the accuracy of the internal models governing the synergy between the saccadic and pursuit systems with age. Altogether, we hypothesize that the maturation of the interaction between smooth pursuit and saccades that relies on internal models of the eye and target displacement is related to the continuous maturation of the cerebellum.},

	abstract = {A wide range of motor function declines with aging. Motor adaptation, which occurs when participants learn to reach accurately to a target despite a perturbation, does not deviate from this rule. There are currently three major hypotheses that have been put forward to explain this age-related decline in adaptation: deterioration of internal model recalibration due to age-related cerebellar degeneration, impairment of the cognitive component of motor adaptation, and deficit in the retention of the learned movement. In the present study, we systematically investigated these three hypotheses and demonstrate that age-related deficits in motor adaptation are not due to impaired internal model recalibration or impaired retention of motor memory. Rather, we found that the cognitive component was reduced in older people. Therefore, our study suggests the interesting possibility that cerebellar-based mechanisms do not deteriorate with age despite cerebellar degeneration. In contrast, internal model recalibration appears to compensate for deficits in the cognitive component of this type of learning.},

After much debate about this process, reliability-based integration has recently been proposed and several models of smooth pursuit now include recurrent Bayesian integration or Kalman filtering. However, there is a lack of behavioral evidence supporting these theoretical predictions. Here, we independently manipulated the reliability of visual and prior information in a smooth pursuit task. Our results show that both smooth pursuit eye velocity and catch-up saccade amplitude were modulated by visual and prior information reliability. We interpret these findings as the continuous reliability-based integration of a short-term memory of target motion with visual information, which support modelling work. Furthermore, we suggest that saccadic and pursuit systems share this short-term memory. We propose that this short-term memory of target motion is quickly built and continuously updated, and constitutes a general building-block present in all sensorimotor systems.},

	abstract = {Motor adaptation to an external perturbation relies on several mechanisms such as model-based, model-free, strategic, or repetition-dependent learning. Depending on the experimental conditions, each of these mechanisms has more or less weight in the final adaptation state. Here we focused on the conditions that lead to the formation of a model-free motor memory (Huang VS, Haith AM, Mazzoni P, Krakauer JW. Neuron 70: 787-801, 2011), i.e., a memory that does not depend on an internal model or on the size or direction of the errors experienced during the learning. The formation of such model-free motor memory was hypothesized to depend on the schedule of the perturbation (Orban de Xivry JJ, Ahmadi-Pajouh MA, Harran MD, Salimpour Y, Shadmehr R. J Neurophysiol 109: 124-136, 2013). Here we built on this observation by directly testing the nature of the motor memory after abrupt or gradual introduction of a visuomotor rotation, in an experimental paradigm where the presence of model-free motor memory can be identified (Huang VS, Haith AM, Mazzoni P, Krakauer JW. Neuron 70: 787-801, 2011). We found that relearning was faster after abrupt than gradual perturbation, which suggests that model-free learning is reduced during gradual adaptation to a visuomotor rotation. In addition, the presence of savings after abrupt introduction of the perturbation but gradual extinction of the motor memory suggests that unexpected errors are necessary to induce a model-free motor memory. Overall, these data support the hypothesis that different perturbation schedules do not lead to a more or less stabilized motor memory but to distinct motor memories with different attributes and neural representations.},

That is, we sought to determine whether divergent background activity levels within the sensorimotor cortex (anodal: higher activity; cathodal: lower activity) give rise to distinct motor memories. After a training session, application of each tDCS polarity automatically resulted in the retrieval of the motor memory corresponding to that polarity.

In this paradigm, adolescent were instructed to follow a moving target with their eyes even during its transient disappearance. Given the absence of visual information during the blanking period, eye movements during this period are solely controlled on the basis of the prediction of the ongoing target motion. Typical markers of predictive eye movements such as the number and accuracy of predictive saccades and the predictive reacceleration before target reappearance were identical in the two populations. In addition, the synergy of predictive saccades and smooth pursuit observed during the blanking periods, which is a marker for the quality of internal models about target/eye motions, was comparable between these two populations. These results suggest that, in our large population of high-functioning autistic adolescent, both predictive abilities and internal models are left intact in Autism, at least for low-level sensorimotor transformation.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate associative learning effects in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (prAD) by referring to the Temporal Context Model (TCM; Howard, Jing, Rao, Provyn, \& Datey, 2009), in an attempt to enhance the understanding of their associative memory impairment. TCM explains fundamental effects described in classical free-recall tasks and cued-recall tasks involving overlapping word pairs (e.g., A-B, B-C), namely (1) the contiguity effect, which is the tendency to successively recall nearby items in a list, and (2) the observation of backward (i.e., B-A) and transitive associations (i.e., A-C) between items. In TCM, these effects are hypothesized to rely on contextual representation, binding and retrieval processes, which supposedly depend on hippocampal and parahippocampal regions. As these regions are affected in prAD, the current study investigated whether prAD patients would show reduced proportions of backward and transitive associations in free and cued-recall, coupled to a reduced contiguity effect in free-recall. Seventeen older controls and 17 prAD patients performed a cued-recall task involving overlapping word pairs and a final free-recall task. Proportions of backward and transitive intrusions in cued-recall did not significantly differ between groups. However, in free-recall, prAD patients demonstrated a reduced contiguity effect as well as reduced proportions of backward and transitive associations compared to older controls. These findings are discussed within the hypothesis that the contextual representation, binding and/or retrieval processes are affected in prAD patients compared to healthy older individuals.

	abstract = {Learning to control our movements is accompanied by neuroplasticity of motor areas of the brain. The mechanisms of neuroplasticity are diverse and produce what is referred to as the motor engram, i.e., the neural trace of the motor memory. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) alters the neural and behavioral correlates of motor learning, but its precise influence on the motor engram is unknown. In this review, we summarize the effects of tDCS on neural activity and suggest a few key principles: (1) Firing rates are increased by anodal polarization and decreased by cathodal polarization, (2) anodal polarization strengthens newly formed associations, and (3) polarization modulates the memory of new/preferred firing patterns. With these principles in mind, we review the effects of tDCS on motor control, motor learning, and clinical applications. The increased spontaneous and evoked firing rates may account for the modulation of dexterity in non-learning tasks by tDCS. The facilitation of new association may account for the effect of tDCS on learning in sequence tasks while the ability of tDCS to strengthen memories of new firing patterns may underlie the effect of tDCS on consolidation of skills. We then describe the mechanisms of neuroplasticity of motor cortical areas and how they might be influenced by tDCS. We end with current challenges for the fields of brain stimulation and motor learning.},

	abstract = {Each task requires a specific motor behavior that is tuned to task demands. For instance, writing requires a lot of accuracy while clapping does not. It is known that the brain adjusts the motor behavior to different task demands as predicted by optimal control theory. In this study, the mechanism of this reoptimization process is investigated by varying the accuracy demands of a reaching task. In this task, the width of the reaching target (0.5 or 8 cm) was varied either on a trial-to-trial basis (random schedule) or in blocks (blocked schedule). On some trials, the hand of the subjects was clamped to a rectilinear trajectory that ended 2 cm on the left or right of the target center. The rejection of this perturbation largely varied with target width in the blocked schedule but not in the random schedule. That is, subjects exhibited different motor behavior in the different schedules despite identical accuracy demands. Therefore, while reoptimization has been considered immediate and automatic, the differences in motor behavior observed across schedules suggest that the reoptimization of the motor behavior is neither happening on a trial-by-trial basis nor obligatory. The absence of trial-to-trial mechanisms, the inability of the brain to adapt to two conflicting task demands and the existence of a switching cost are discussed as possible sources of the non-optimality of motor behavior during the random schedule.},

For instance, predictive mechanisms improve the perception of a moving target by increasing eye speed anticipatively, thus reducing motion blur on the retina. Subregions of the frontal lobes play a key role in eye movements in general and in smooth pursuit in particular, but their precise function is not firmly established. Here, the role of frontal lobes in the timing of predictive action is demonstrated by studying predictive smooth pursuit during transient blanking of a moving target in mild frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. While control subjects and AD patients predictively reaccelerated their eyes before the predicted time of target reappearance, FTLD patients did not. The difference was so dramatic (classification accuracy {\textbackslash}textgreater90\%) that it could even lead to the definition of a new biomarker. In contrast, anticipatory eye movements triggered by the disappearance of the fixation point were still present before target motion onset in FTLD patients and visually guided pursuit was normal in both patient groups compared with controls. Therefore, FTLD patients were only impaired when the predicted timing of an external event was required to elicit an action. These results argue in favor of a role of the frontal lobes in predictive movement timing.},

Here, we measured the state of the primary motor cortex (M1) and the corticospinal network during adaptation by measuring motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) before reach onset using transcranial magnetic stimulation of M1. Subjects reached in a force field in a schedule in which the field was introduced either abruptly or gradually over many trials. In both groups, by end of the training, muscles that countered the perturbation in a given direction increased their activity during the reach (labeled as the on direction for each muscle). In the abrupt group, in the period before the reach toward the on direction, MEPs in these muscles also increased, suggesting a direction-specific increase in the excitability of the corticospinal network. However, in the gradual group, these MEP changes were missing. After training, there was a period of washout. The MEPs did not return to baseline. Rather, in the abrupt group, off direction MEPs increased to match on direction MEPs. Therefore, we observed changes in corticospinal excitability in the abrupt but not gradual condition. Abrupt training includes the repetition of motor commands, and repetition may be the key factor that produces this plasticity. Furthermore, washout did not return MEPs to baseline, suggesting that washout engaged a new network that masked but did not erase the effects of previous adaptation. Abrupt but not gradual training appears to induce changes in M1 and/or corticospinal networks.},

Computational and behavioral studies have suggested that acquisition and retention of a new visuomotor transformation are distinct processes. However, this dissociation has never been clearly shown. Here, participants made fast reaching movements while unexpectedly a 30-degree visuomotor transformation was introduced. During visuomotor adaptation, subjects received cerebellar, primary motor cortex (M1) or sham anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive form of brain stimulation known to increase excitability. We found that cerebellar tDCS caused faster adaptation to the visuomotor transformation, as shown by a rapid reduction of movement errors. These findings were not present with similar modulation of visual cortex excitability. In contrast, tDCS over M1 did not affect adaptation, but resulted in a marked increase in retention of the newly learnt visuomotor transformation. These results show a clear dissociation in the processes of acquisition and retention during adaptive motor learning and demonstrate that the cerebellum and primary motor cortex have distinct functional roles. Furthermore, they show that is possible to enhance cerebellar function using tDCS.},

In the abrupt condition (introduction of the perturbation on a single trial followed by constant perturbation), motor output adapted rapidly and was then followed by significant repetition as performance plateaued. TMS of M1 had no effect on the rapid adaptation phase but reduced adaptation at the plateau. In the intermediate condition (introduction of the perturbation over 45 trials), disruption of M1 had no effect on the phase in which motor output changed but again impaired adaptation when performance had plateaued. Finally, when the perturbation was imposed gradually (over 240 trials), the motor commands continuously changed during adaptation and never repeated, and disruption of M1 had no effect on performance. Therefore, TMS of M1 appeared to reduce adaptation of motor commands during a specific phase of learning: when motor commands tended to repeat.},

In order for the eye to smoothly pursue a moving object that is transiently occluded, a prediction of its trajectory is necessary. For targets moving on a linear path, predictive eye velocity can be regulated on the basis of target motion before and after the occlusions. However, objects in a more dynamic environment move along more complex trajectories. In this condition, a dynamic internal representation of target motion is required. Yet, the nature of such an internal representation has never been investigated. Similarly, the impact of predictive saccades on the predictive smooth pursuit response has never been considered. Therefore, we investigated the predictive smooth pursuit and saccadic responses during the occlusion of a target moving along a circular path. We found that the predictive smooth pursuit was driven by an internal representation of target motion that evolved with time. In addition, we demonstrated that in two dimensions, the predictive smooth pursuit system does influence the amplitude of predictive saccades but not vice versa. In conclusion, in the absence of retinal inputs, the smooth pursuit system is driven by the output of a short-term velocity memory that contains the dynamic representation of target motion.},

In addition to compensating for the perceptual-motor delay, these predictive processes perpetuate eye motion during a transient occlusion and compensate for the loss of visual input. At present, however, it is not well understood whether and how the oculomotor system extracts and represents target acceleration for subsequent predictive control. To this end, we used a target occlusion paradigm where both position and velocity of the target during the occlusion and at reappearance could not be predicted without extracting target acceleration before target disappearance. We found that the oculomotor response during the blanking period was not influenced by target acceleration when the initial exposure was 200 ms. However, smooth and saccadic eye movements did discriminate between the different levels of acceleration after an initial 500- or 800-ms exposure. In the event that the smooth response during the occlusion did not match well the target trajectory and thus eliminate a developing displacement error, there was an increased saccadic displacement. Still, the combined response during the blanking period did not eliminate retinal slip and position error at target reappearance. These results indicate that information on target acceleration can be extracted on-line, during pursuit of a visible ramp, and then used to drive a predictive oculomotor response in the absence of visual input.},

Since binocular vision in Duane Retraction Syndrome (DRS) patients is normal in half of their horizontal field of gaze (i.e., sound-side of gaze), we wondered whether oculomotor adaptive capabilities are efficient despite such a severe impairment of eye motility towards the other half of the horizontal field of gaze (i.e., affected-side gaze). We compared properties of horizontal saccades of patients with congenital unilateral Duane Retraction Syndrome type I in binocular viewing and monocular viewing conditions by simultaneously recording both eyes with the search coil technique. Our results show a mismatch between the pulse and the step signal of the innervation for saccades. When tested in the affected eye viewing condition (sound eye covered), the eyes showed not only similarly-directed increases of the saccadic gain (pulse signal) in the two eyes but also disjunctive post-saccadic drifts (step signal). This behavior suggests that visuomotor errors presented only to the affected eye were transferred to the sound eye, producing conjugate changes of the saccadic command. The post-saccadic command remained unchanged, however, and controlled the final position of each eye separately. This suggests that monocular adaptation is possible only for the step of innervation (i.e., controlling the final eye position) but not for the pulse of innervation (i.e., controlling the saccadic gain), even though the peculiarity of unilateral DRS type I offers a clear advantage for separate pathways of control for the two eyes.},

	abstract = {Visual tracking of moving objects requires prediction to compensate for visual delays and minimize mismatches between eye and target position and velocity. In everyday life, objects often disappear behind an occluder, and prediction is required to align eye and target at reappearance. Earlier studies investigating eye motion during target blanking showed that eye velocity first decayed after disappearance but was sustained or often recovered in a predictive way. Furthermore, saccades were directed toward the unseen target trajectory and therefore appeared to correct for position errors resulting from eye velocity decay. To investigate the synergy between smooth and saccadic eye movements, this study used a target blanking paradigm where both position and velocity of the target at reappearance could vary independently but were presented repeatedly to facilitate prediction. We found that eye velocity at target reappearance was only influenced by expected target velocity, whereas saccades responded to the expected change of target position at reappearance. Moreover, subjects exhibited on-line adaptation, on a trial-by-trial basis, between smooth and saccadic components; i.e., saccades compensated for variability of smooth eye displacement during the blanking period such that gaze at target reappearance was independent of the level of smooth eye displacement. We suggest these results indicate that information arising from efference copies of saccadic and smooth pursuit systems are combined with the goal of adjusting eye position at target reappearance. Based on prior experimental evidence, we hypothesize that this spatial remapping is carried out through interactions between a number of identified neurophysiological structures.},

For example, the decision to execute a saccade and its amplitude is driven by the difference in velocity between the eye and the target. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the predictive saccades that occur during the blanking of the moving target compensate for the variability of the smooth pursuit response. Therefore, we wondered whether the predictive smooth pursuit response during target blanking influenced the occurrence of predictive saccades, which is the case for visually guided catch-up saccades. To answer this question, we asked subjects to track visually a target moving along a circular path. From time to time, the target was unexpectedly blanked for some randomized durations and disappeared from the screen. Surprisingly, we did not find any differences in smooth pursuit performance between the blanks that did and those that did not contain predictive saccades. In addition, during the blanks, the differences in smooth pursuit performance across the sessions or across the subjects did not correlate with the differences in the number of predictive saccades. Therefore, this study demonstrates that smooth pursuit performance does not influence the occurrence of predictive saccades. We interpret these results in light of the possible minimization of position error at target reappearance, which heavily depends on the saccadic amplitudes but not on their timing.},

Suppose that the purpose of any movement is to position our body in a more rewarding state. People and other animals discount future reward as a hyperbolic function of time. Here, we show that across populations of people and monkeys there is a correlation between discounting of reward and control of movements. We consider saccadic eye movements and hypothesize that duration of a movement is equivalent to a delay of reward. The hyperbolic cost of this delay not only accounts for kinematics of saccades in adults, it also accounts for the faster saccades of children, who temporally discount reward more steeply. Our theory explains why saccade velocities increase when reward is elevated, and why disorders in the encoding of reward, for example in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, produce changes in saccade. We show that delay of reward elevates the cost of saccades, reducing velocities. Finally, we consider coordinated movements that include motion of eyes and head and find that their kinematics is also consistent with a hyperbolic, reward-dependent cost of time. Therefore, each voluntary movement carries a cost because its duration delays acquisition of reward. The cost depends on the value that the brain assigns to stimuli, and the rate at which it discounts this value in time. The motor commands that move our eyes reflect this cost of time.},

	abstract = {Humans are very sensitive to the presence of other living persons or animals in their surrounding. Human actions can readily be perceived, even in a noisy environment. We recently demonstrated that biological motion, which schematically represents human motion, influences smooth pursuit eye movements during the initiation period (Orban de Xivry, Coppe, Lefèvre, \& Missal, 2010). This smooth pursuit response is driven both by a visuomotor pathway, which transforms retinal inputs into motor commands, and by a memory pathway, which is directly related to the predictive properties of smooth pursuit. To date, it is unknown which of these pathways is influenced by biological motion. In the present study, we first use a theoretical model to demonstrate that an influence of biological motion on the visuomotor and memory pathways might both explain its influence on smooth pursuit initiation. In light of this model, we made theoretical predictions of the possible influence of biological motion on smooth pursuit during and after the transient blanking of the stimulus. These qualitative predictions were then compared with recordings of eye movements acquired before, during and after the transient blanking of the stimulus. The absence of difference in smooth pursuit eye movements during blanking of the stimuli and the stronger visually guided smooth pursuit reacceleration after reappearance of the biological motion stimuli in comparison with control stimuli suggests that biological motion influences the visuomotor pathway but not the memory pathway.},

	abstract = {The present study examined the influence of long-term (i.e., between-trial) and short-term (i.e., within-trial) predictive mechanisms on ocular pursuit during transient occlusion. To this end, we compared ocular pursuit of accelerative and decelerative target motion in trials that were presented in random or blocked-order. Catch trials in which target acceleration was unexpectedly modified were randomly interleaved in blocked-order trials. Irrespective of trial order, eye velocity decayed following target occlusion and then recovered towards the different levels of target velocity at reappearance. However, the recovery was better scaled in blocked-order trials than random-order trials. In blocked-order trials only, the reduced gain of smooth pursuit during occlusion was compensated by a change in saccade amplitude and resulted in total eye displacement (TED) that was well matched to target displacement. Subsidiary analysis indicated that three repeats of blocked-order trials was sufficient for participants to modify eye displacement compared to that exhibited in random-order trials, although more trials were required before end-occlusion eye velocity was better scaled. Finally, we found that participants exhibited evidence of a scaled response to an unexpected change in target acceleration (i.e., catch trials), although there were also transfer effects from the preceding blocked-order trials. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that on-the-fly prediction (short-term effect) is combined with memorized information from previous trials (long-term effect) to generate a persistent and veridical prediction of occluded target motion.},

In this study, we investigate whether this biological motion perception network could influence the smooth pursuit response evoked by a point-light walker. We found that smooth eye velocity during pursuit initiation was larger in response to the point-light walker than in response to one of its scrambled versions, to an inverted walker or to a single dot stimulus. In addition, we assessed the proximity to the point-light walker (i.e. the amount of information about the direction contained in the scrambled stimulus and extracted from local motion cue of biological motion) of each of our scrambled stimuli in a motion direction discrimination task with manual responses and found that the smooth pursuit response evoked by those stimuli moving across the screen was modulated by their proximity to the walker. Therefore, we conclude that biological motion facilitates smooth pursuit eye movements, hence influences both perception and action.},

	abstract = {Background. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested to improve poststroke recovery. However, its effects on bimanual motor learning after stroke have not previously been explored. Objective. We investigated whether dual-tDCS of the primary motor cortex (M1), with cathodal and anodal tDCS applied over undamaged and damaged hemispheres, respectively, improves learning and retention of a new bimanual cooperative motor skill in stroke patients. Method. Twenty-one chronic hemiparetic patients were recruited for a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over, sham-controlled trial. While receiving real or sham dual-tDCS, they trained on a bimanual cooperative task called CIRCUIT. Changes in performance were quantified via bimanual speed/accuracy trade-off (Bi-SAT) and bimanual coordination factor (Bi-Co) before, during, and 0, 30, and 60 minutes after dual-tDCS, as well as one week later to measure retention. A generalization test then followed, where patients were asked to complete a new CIRCUIT layout. Results. The patients were able to learn and retain the bimanual cooperative skill. However, a general linear mixed model did not detect a significant difference in retention between the real and sham dual-tDCS conditions for either Bi-SAT or Bi-Co. Similarly, no difference in generalization was detected for Bi-SAT or Bi-Co. Conclusion. The chronic hemiparetic stroke patients learned and retained the complex bimanual cooperative task and generalized the newly acquired skills to other tasks, indicating that bimanual CIRCUIT training is promising as a neurorehabilitation approach. However, bimanual motor skill learning was not enhanced by dual-tDCS in these patients.},

	abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have highlighted that corticospinal excitability is increased during observation of object lifting, an effect termed “motor resonance.” This facilitation is driven by movement features indicative of object weight, such as object size or observed movement kinematics. Here, we investigated in 35 humans (23 females) how motor resonance is altered when the observer's weight expectations, based on visual information, do not match the actual object weight as revealed by the observed movement kinematics. Our results highlight that motor resonance is not robustly driven by object weight but easily masked by a suppressive mechanism reflecting the correctness of weight expectations. Subsequently, we investigated in 24 humans (14 females) whether this suppressive mechanism was driven by higher-order cortical areas. For this, we induced “virtual lesions” to either the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) before having participants perform the task. Importantly, virtual lesion of pSTS eradicated this suppressive mechanism and restored object weight-driven motor resonance. In addition, DLPFC virtual lesion eradicated any modulation of motor resonance. This indicates that motor resonance is heavily mediated by top-down inputs from both pSTS and DLPFC. Together, these findings shed new light on the theorized cortical network driving motor resonance. That is, our findings highlight that motor resonance is not only driven by the putative human mirror neuron network consisting of the primary motor and premotor cortices as well as the anterior intraparietal sulcus, but also by top-down input from pSTS and DLPFC.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Observation of object lifting activates the observer's motor system in a weight-specific fashion: Corticospinal excitability is larger when observing lifts of heavy objects compared with light ones. Interestingly, here we demonstrate that this weight-driven modulation of corticospinal excitability is easily suppressed by the observer's expectations about object weight and that this suppression is mediated by the posterior superior temporal sulcus. Thus, our findings show that modulation of corticospinal excitability during observed object lifting is not robust but easily altered by top-down cognitive processes. Finally, our results also indicate how cortical inputs, originating remotely from motor pathways and processing action observation, overlap with bottom-up motor resonance effects.},

We provide evidence for a lower weight of visual information during smooth pursuit in amblyopic and control subjects tracking a blurry target, with no significant difference of prior information weight. In contrast, we found no evidence of lower visual information weight in the catch-up saccades of amblyopic subjects. We conclude that oculomotor performance in unilateral amblyopia mostly lays within the continuum between our control groups, without significant differences in the relative weights of prior and visual information.

Yet, in other motor tasks, older adults appear to rely on cognition to improve their motor performance. It is unknown why older adults are not able to do so in motor adaptation. In order to solve this apparent contradiction, we tested the possibility that older adults require more cognitive resources in unperturbed reaching compared to younger adults, which leaves fewer resources available for the cognitive aspect of motor adaptation. Two cognitive-motor dual-task experiments were designed to test this. The cognitive load of unperturbed reaching was assessed via dual-task costs during the baseline period of visuomotor rotation experiments, which provided us with an estimation of the amount of cognitive resources used during unperturbed reaching. However, since we did not observe a link between dual-task costs and explicit adaptation in both experiments, we failed to confirm this hypothesis. Instead, we observed that explicit adaptation was mainly associated with visuospatial working memory capacity. This suggests that visuospatial working memory of an individual might be linked to the extent of explicit adaptation for young and older adults.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Motor adaptation, which occurs when participants learn to reach accurately to a target despite a perturbation, does not deviate from this rule. There are currently 3 major hypotheses that have been put forward to explain this age-related decline in adaptation: deterioration of internal model recalibration due to age-related cerebellar degeneration, impairment of the cognitive component of motor adaptation, and deficit in the retention of the learned movement. In the present study, we systematically investigated these 3 hypotheses in a large sample of older women and men. We demonstrate that age-related deficits in motor adaptation are not due to impaired internal model recalibration or impaired retention of motor memory. Rather, we found that the cognitive component was reduced in older people. Therefore, our study suggests the interesting possibility that cerebellar-based mechanisms do not deteriorate with age despite cerebellar degeneration. In contrast, internal model recalibration appears to compensate for deficits in the cognitive component of this type of learning.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Identifying older adults with increased fall risk due to poor postural control on a large scale is only possible through omnipresent and low cost measuring devices such as the inertial measurement units (IMU) embedded in smartphones. However, the correlation between smartphone measures of postural stability and state-of-the-art force plate measures has never been assessed in a large sample allowing us to take into account age as a covariate. Research question: How reliably can postural stability be measured with a smartphone embedded IMU in comparison to a force plate? Methods: We assessed balance in 97 adults aged 50 to 90 years in four different conditions (eyes open, eyes closed, semi-tandem and dual-task) in the anterio-posterior and medio-lateral directions. We used six different parameters (root mean square and average absolute value of COP displacement, velocity and acceleration) for the force plate and two different parameters (root mean square and average absolute value of COM acceleration) for the smartphone. Results: Test-retest reliability was smaller for the smartphone than for the force plate (intra class correlation) but both devices could equally well detect differences between conditions (similar Cohen9s d). Parameters from the smartphone and the force plate, with age regressed out, were moderately correlated (robust correlation coefficients of around 0.5). Significance: This study comprehensively documents test-retest reliability and effect sizes for stability measures obtained with a force plate and smartphone as well as correlations between force plate and smartphone measures based on a large sample of older adults. Our large sample size allowed us to reliably determine the strength of the correlations between force plate and smartphone measures. The most important practical implication of our results is that more repetitions or longer trials are required when using a smartphone instead of a force plate to assess balance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This study analyzed the characteristics of pursuit and assessed the influence of prior and visual information on eye velocity and saccades in amblyopic and control children, in comparison to adults. Eye movements of 41 children (21 amblyopes and 20 controls) were compared to eye movements of 55 adults (18 amblyopes and 37 controls). Participants were asked to pursue a target moving at a constant velocity. The target was either a ‘standard’ target, with a uniform color intensity, or a ‘noisy’ target, with blurry edges, to mimic the blurriness of an amblyopic eye. Analysis of pursuit patterns showed that the onset was delayed, and the gain was decreased in control children with a noisy target in comparison to amblyopic or control children with a standard target. Furthermore, a significant effect of prior and visual information on pursuit velocity and saccades was found across all participants. Moreover, the modulation of the effect of visual information on the pursuit velocity by group, that is amblyopes or controls with a standard target, and controls with a noisy target, was more limited in children. In other words, the effect of visual information was higher in control adults with a standard target compared to control children with the same target. However, in the case of a blurry target, either in control participants with a noisy target or in amblyopic participants with a standard target, the effect of visual information was larger in children.},
