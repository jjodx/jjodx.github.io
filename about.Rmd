###who am I
I am an engineer in applied mathematics who did his PhD (2002-2007) on computational neuroscience at the Université catholique de Louvain (Belgium). During my PhD, I focused on eye movements with applications to clinical populations. I went on to pursue my post-doctoral work (2008-2010) with Reza Shadmehr at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD, USA) where I used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to investigate the role of the motor cortex in motor adaptation. My post-doctoral stay at Hopkins was partially supported by a Fellowship from the Belgian American Educational Foundation. Then, I secured independent funding from the Brussels region (2011-2014: 610 000€) in order to pursue my research as an independent investigator at UCLouvain on how theories of motor control can be successfully applied to understand brain functions in health and disease.

Since December 2014, I am a Professor (2014-2019: assistant; now associated) at the department of Movement Sciences at KU Leuven where my project focuses on the effect of aging and neurological disease on motor control and learning via a multimodal approach (behavior, brain stimulation and EEG). So far these projects have been funded by an internal starting grant from KU Leuven (100 000€), a small research grant from the FWO (40 000€) and a large internal grant from KU Leuven (498500€) on the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation on retention of motor learning in healthy old participants and in Parkinson’s Disease patients. 

In addition, I am one of the founding member of the BRain Activity, Imaging & NeuroStimulation for HUman Behaviour research platform (BRAINS-HUB, KU Leuven, Belgium) for which we received a small equipment grant from KU Leuven (main PI, 87 000€) and, as co-PI, a large Hercules grant (878000€). 

Finally, I decided to use state-of-the-art research methodologies for the research in my laboratory. All papers are first published as prepritnts (e.g. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/292250v2). All data and code are made available on the Open Science Framework (e.g. https://osf.io/vncce/) and studies are pre-registered when possible (https://osf.io/n8bwf/). In addition, I try to provide several lines of evidence to backup the claims in my papers by replicating my own results and using larger group of participants (N=20 or 30 per group). One of our latest paper (Vandevoorde and Orban de Xivry 2019) is a good example of what we wants to achieve in the laboratory.
