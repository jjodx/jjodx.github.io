JJ is a firm believer of Open Science. Here are two interviews on this topic:

* [On the Open Science website of the KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/open-science/news/2021/J-J_Orban)<br>
* [About our ten statistical mistake paper](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/ten-most-common-mistakes-with-statistics-and-how-to-avoid-them)<br>

I have also given presentations on Open Science for:

* the PhD day of the Neuroscience Institute of UCLouvain<br>
* the Moss Rehabilitation Institute<br>
* the research group in Movement control and Neuroplasticity of the KU Leuven<br>
* the research group in neuromotor rehabilitation of the KU Leuven<br>

I have been involved in a working group on Open Science for the KU Leuven for the research policy council of the KU Leuven (head: Prof. Alice Nieuwboer)
