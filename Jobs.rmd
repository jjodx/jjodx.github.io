### <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" ></i> Qualified applicants
In our lab, we study humans actions from a multidisciplinary perspective involving psychophysics, mathematical modelling, brain stimulation and neuroimaging. We aim at assembling a team of multidisciplinary scientists to enrich the lab's thinking.
<br>
Therefore, members of the lab can have the following backgrounds: rehabilitation sciences, movement sciences, neuroscience, psychology or a more computational background (engineering, physics, mathematics).
<br>

### <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" ></i> The lab
The lab is part of the [Movement Control and Neurosplasticity Research group](https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50000737/groups/50487173) at [KU leuven](www.kuleuven.be). Our group has a strong expertise in many aspects of motor control and motor learning and in many neuroscience techniques (fMRI, EEG, TMS, tDCS, tACS, psychophysics), which are centralized in the Brains-Hub (center devoted to the study of Brain Activity, Imaging & NeuroStimulation for Human Behaviour).
