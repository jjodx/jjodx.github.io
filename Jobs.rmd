### <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" ></i> Qualified applicants
In our lab, we study humans actions from a multidisciplinary perspective involving psychophysics, mathematical modelling, brain stimulation and neuroimaging. We aim at assembling a team of multidisciplinary scientists to enrich the lab's thinking.
<br>
Therefore, members of the lab can have the following backgrounds: rehabilitation sciences, movement sciences, neuroscience, psychology or a more computational background (engineering, physics, mathematics).
<br>

### <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" ></i> The lab
The lab is part of the [Movement Control and Neurosplasticity Research group](https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50000737/groups/50487173) at [KU leuven](www.kuleuven.be). Our group has a strong expertise in many aspects of motor control and motor learning and in many neuroscience techniques (fMRI, EEG, TMS, tDCS, tACS, psychophysics), which are centralized in the Brains-Hub (center devoted to the study of Brain Activity, Imaging & NeuroStimulation for Human Behaviour).
<br>

### <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" ></i> Potential PhD students

__vacancy__ : deadline 31st of March 2021

The lab is seeking two additional PhD students to work on the effect of age on the cerebellum and on motor control. This project involves behavioral test batteries and structural MRI. Candidates should be available to start mid-2021. If you are interested, email <i class="fa fa-at"></i>  [JJ Orban de Xivry](mailto:jj.orban@kuleuven.be).
